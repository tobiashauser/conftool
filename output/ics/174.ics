DESCRIPTION:<p>Experimentation with musical instrument-objects has been cen
 tral to contemporary music of the past 60 years. High-constraint ‘found’ ob
 jects\, ‘homemade’ instruments\, hybrid found/homemade-classical instrument
 s\, rudimentary electronics\, interfaces\, prepared classical instruments\,
  and so-called ‘extended techniques’ have shaped musical expression. The ‘p
 erformance turn’ triggered a practitioner-led refocusing of music research.
  And yet\, this new instrumentarium\, so fundamental to today’s music\, and
  to today’s performers\, has received surprisingly little research attentio
 n. Physical and musicological research lags behind practice\, and the ‘cata
 loguing’ tendencies of composer-led work has had the effect of discretizing
  actions and sounds that can often be expressed in continuous scales bounde
 d by action-sound parameters. Moreover\, Sachs’ organological classificatio
 ns of musical instruments by their materials and playing techniques has rem
 ained almost unchanged since its first publication in 1940.</p>\n<p>In his 
 monograph on the philosophy of science\, Baird (2004) describes a ‘text bia
 s’ in the history of science that has undervalued scientific instruments in
  favour of theory such that the epistemology of instruments\, their ‘thing 
 knowledge’\, and its contribution to scientific understanding has not been 
 recognized. Could the same argument be made for musical instruments? New lu
 thier Thor Magnusson describes the epistemology of musical instruments as t
 heir containing of a music theory (Magnusson 2019). Could performance pract
 ice and composition practice be described as an unravelling of the music th
 eory intrinsically contained in a music instrument object? The application 
 of this idea to music instruments has much to offer found\, adapted\, and h
 omemade instruments\, and classical instruments that are prepared and playe
 d in ways that were not intended by the original instrument makers\, but ar
 e nonetheless highly idiomatic. Lachenmann’s <em>musique concrète instrumen
 tale </em>aims to liberate sound from music-historical baggage by asserting
  the acoustical connections between instruments\, actions\, and sounds\, wi
 thout prioritizing historically more weighted techniques (Lachenmann 2004).
  Not only is the knowledge of the sound-producing actions of an instrument 
 central to this concept\, but also the communication of this ‘thing knowled
 ge’ to performer and audience. In this presentation I will discuss how to d
 efine and extract musical instruments’ ‘thing knowledge’ and the implicatio
 ns for a re-thinking of organology.</p>\n
