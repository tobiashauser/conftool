DESCRIPTION:<p>Stereotype threat occurs in situations where existing negati
 ve attitudes about a person’s group result in concerns of judgment and thus
  undermine performance and expression as discussed in Spencer et al (2016).
  The art form jazz still has the lowest participation of female instrumenta
 lists\, thus making them a minority group often under the crucial 15% mark\
 , the numerical value that often triggers deep-rooted assumptions and stere
 otype threat. Research on possible solutions has been approached from many 
 angles – historical analysis\, social observations\, experimental deduction
 s\, building theories\, but very little from an artistic research perspecti
 ve. What is the impact of stereotyping on the creative process and the musi
 cal outcomes? As a female jazz pianist\, how do I respond to stereotype thr
 eat in various situations and how does that affect my performance and music
 al process? How might the sound of jazz change as stereotype threat slowly 
 disappears with more inclusive policies and diversification? Artistic resea
 rch helps us understand these questions and communicate answers through the
  language of music\, reaching far beyond words. In this keynote address aud
 iences will experience stereotyping and various research approaches. Prinip
 les of Artistic Research will be discussed and exemplified.</p>\n<p>Lit.: S
