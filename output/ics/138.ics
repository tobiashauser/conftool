DESCRIPTION:<p>            George Rochberg’s philosophy of <em>ars combinat
 oria</em> is described as “standing in a circle of time\, not a line\,” mak
 ing possible “movement in any direction” (Rochberg 132\, 134). This paper p
 resents three novel methods of tonal-atonal blend in music post-1970—flippi
 ng\, repurposing\, and evolving—which place tonality on the same plane as a
 tonality\; simply another harmonic language. Following Johnson’s article “T
 onality as Topic\,” I borrow “tonal <em>figurae\,</em>” musical features th
 at serve as signifiers of tonality’s essence (shown in slashes)\, such as /
 triads/\, /consonance/\, or /functional harmony/ (Johnson 2017). Considerin
 g Rochberg’s desire to use all information available\, this paper introduce
 s “atonal <em>figurae\,</em>” <em></em>which include \\pitch-class set mani
 pulation\\\, \\serialism\\\, and \\extended techniques\\\, among others (sh
 own in backslashes). Previous scholarship has examined a tonal-atonal blend
  via analysis of a singular <em>figura</em>\, such as /triads/ in Schnittke
 \, \\quotation\\ in Rochberg\, and \\chromatic saturation\\ in collage work
 s (Segall 2017\, Wlodarski 2019\, Losada 2009). This paper recognizes multi
 ple <em>figurae </em>simultaneously\, revealing that the interaction of con
 trasting <em>figurae</em> creates a blended <em>ars combinatoria.</em></p>\
 n<p><em>            </em>This paper contains three analyses of works by Wil
 liam Bolcom\, Christopher Rouse\, and Frederic Rzewski\, followed by an in-
 depth analysis of Rzewski's <em>Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues</em>. In these 
 examples\, the three methods of <em>ars combinatoria </em>will be made evid
 ent. The “flipping” method is a rapid switch between opposing <em>figurae\,
  </em>which weaves together tonal and atonal <em>figurae</em> much like fli
 pping a light switch on and off. “Repurposing” consists of content original
 ly seen in one <em>figura</em> recycled in a contrasting <em>figura</em>. R
 epurposing content allows greater motivic continuity than flipping—a single
  thread can be traced through all <em>figurae </em>utilized. The final <em>
 ars combinatoria </em>method\, “evolving\,” features <em>figurae</em> gradu
 ally morphing into contrasting <em>figurae</em>. Evolving requires a moment
  of ambiguity in which opposing <em>figurae</em> cross\, one eventually ove
 rtaking the other.</p>\n<p>            Through the identification of both t
 onal and atonal <em>figurae </em>in a composition\, I will show three metho
 ds in which composers attain Rochberg’s desired seamless blend. Comparing t
 hese techniques with collage and polystylism\, I begin discussion on a larg
 ely ignored body of music\, showing that those who strove for the ideals of
  <em>ars combinatoria</em> found usefulness in the handling of multiple har
 monic languages.</p>\n
