DESCRIPTION:<p>The presentation will showcase an improvisational performanc
 e by a duo consisting of a rapper and an analog synthesizer player. From an
  artistic research perspective\, the project explores several pairs of inte
 ractions during the performative process: the analog-synthesized sound and 
 the rapping voice (HÃ¶rner and Kautny 2009)\; the individual and the collect
 ive (Linson and Clarke 2017)\; and the semantic content and the sonic featu
 res. Apart from the performative activity\, music analysis and self-reflect
 ion are also implemented\, not only during but also after the performance. 
 The digital recordings of the performance enable the spontaneous moment to 
 be accessible and provide possibilities for distanced analysis and reflecti
 on.</p>\n<p>The project has established a model that could contribute to th
 e domain of contemporary music improvisation. With the knowledge gained fro
 m composition and electroacoustic music studies\, the musicians are able to
  focus on the structure of the performance. Instead of a pre-planned struct
 ure\, the improvisation focuses on a constructive process based on the intu
 itive perception of time\, real-time analysis\, and the exchange of musical
  materials between the musicians. As a trigger of inspiration\, several lin
 es of rhymed words or short sentences as rap lyrics are either prepared or 
 written spontaneously before the improvisation\, which could lead to an une
 xpected story\, narration\, and transformation of the structure.</p>\n
