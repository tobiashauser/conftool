DESCRIPTION:<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Expectancy plays an important 
 role in both language and music processing and its study has become a major
  topic in cognitive science research. Meyer (1956) first suggested that emo
 tional responses to music in listeners are determined and triggered by the 
 fulfillment of expectations. Lehrdahl and Jackendoff (1983) posited a music
 al grammar that explains the mental procedures under which the listener con
 structs an unconscious understanding of music -a model comparable to Noam C
 homsky's transformational and generative grammar in the field of linguistic
 s. In recent years\, musical expectation has been introduced into the frame
 work of modern cognitive science and has been studied empirically with beha
 vioral and neural methods. Nevertheless\, most of the research is usually r
 estricted to tonal music.</p>\n<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"></p>\n<p la
 ng="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">For non-tonal music\, I am working on combining
  these perspectives with others such as Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995) Rele
 vance Theory\, in the field of Linguistic Pragmatics\, and the ITPRA Theory
  (Huron\, 2006). Relevance Theory posits that the ostensive and mutually ov
 ert character of utterances automatically generates a set of expectations t
 hat guide the hearer towards the speaker's meaning\; ITPRA Theory defends t
 he phenomenon of surprise as a failure of expectation.</p>\n<p lang="en-us"
  xml:lang="en-us"></p>\n<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Since both music a
 nd language share the cognitive capacity to create expectations\, the aim o
 f this lecture\, related to my PhD project\, is to argue to what extent we 
 can rely on and make use of linguistic theory regarding violation of expect
 ations in non-tonal music contexts.</p>\n<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">T
 he correspondence between the composer's intention and the listener's inter
 pretation in non-tonal music is often misunderstood or unclear. In order to
  understand this gap and considering that expectations create mental and be
 havioral patterns that help us to obtain a prior knowledge to anticipate an
 d predict future events\, the goal is to analyse which musical parameters a
 re likely to form mental patterns in non-tonal music\, so that future music
 al events and their respective expectations can be predicted and understood
  more clearly by listeners.</p>\n<p>I will ilustrate this new theoretical f
 ramework through a case study directly linked to my artistic practice as a 
 singer. I will present interpretative examples of several musical excerpts 
 from Helmut Lachenmann's <em>temA</em> (1968).</p>\n
