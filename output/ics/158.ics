DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>‘Artistic jazz research’\,
  the currently leading type of jazz research\, is largely modelled after ar
 tistic research in classical music\, which itself is modelled after researc
 h methods in the sciences and in philosophy. Where music theory once reigne
 d supreme\, now ‘artistic jazz research’ has taken its place.</p>\n<p>Is ‘a
 rtistic jazz research’ the right format for jazz in the 21st Century? The p
 rice paid for fitting into academia is adapting to traditional musicologica
 l approaches\, to dutifully follow scientific research methods\, and to sub
 ordinate to an outdated peer-review system.</p>\n<p>For many in the jazz wo
 rld\, it is not offering the needed framework for jazz research. The direct
  link is missing to the practice of jazz\, to the applicability of the outc
 ome of the research in jazz performance and education. Jazz performance is 
 real time\, applied jazz theory. In ‘artistic research’ the link to music t
 heory is seldom made.[1]</p>\n<p>‘Applied jazz research’ offers an alternat
 ive to ‘artistic jazz research’:</p>\n<p><em>Research that is fed by\, and 
 that is feeding jazz performance and jazz education.</em></p>\n<p> Applied 
 jazz research links to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jazz performance\;</li>\n<li>The dir
 ection of jazz as artform\;</li>\n<li>New applicable insights in music educ
 ation\, including music theory\;</li>\n<li>The use of modern technology in 
 the teaching of music theory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of the outdated ‘blin
 d peer review’ system\, the ‘dynamic review system\,’ is chosen. The world-
 wide jazz community is the forum to respond to\, elaborate on\, and evaluat
 e the outcomes of applied jazz research.</p>\n<p>The platform for ‘applied 
 jazz research’ is the online ‘IASJ Journal’[2]\, published by Grand Valley 
 State University Libraries.</p>\n<p align="center"> </p>\n<p><strong>Panel 
 topics: </strong></p>\n<p>- Clarifying the terminology: artistic jazz resea
 rch\, applied jazz research\, practice-based research\, (ethno)musicology\,
  popular music studies\, etc.\;</p>\n<p>- The old review policy versus ‘dyn
 amic peer review\;</p>\n<p>- Grand Valley State University Library and the 
 IASJ\, the Research Catalogue\, music theory publishers\, online/new media 
 courses and applied jazz research\;</p>\n<p>- The differences between vario
 us types of jazz research in academies\, conservatories\, and universities\

 tives.</p>\n\n<p>./.</p>\n<br clear="all" />\n<p>[1] See ‘Journal for artis
