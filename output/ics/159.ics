DESCRIPTION:<p>In a concerto by Vivaldi\, we expect abundant evidence of co
 mpound meter in the 18<sup>th</sup>-century sense\, including arbitrary met
 rical shifts and phrases with irregular numbers of half bars (Grave 1985). 
  Discussions of Bach (e.g.\, Marshall 1972\, Grave 1985) often lead to simi
 lar expectations\, but such expectations are false.  In the harpsichord con
 certos\, at least\, a statistical corpus study (previously presented elsewh
 ere) indicates that metrical shifts are rare and that phrases of four notat
 ed bars are prevalent.  While the usual markers of compound meter are by no
  means absent from the harpsichord concertos\, their paucity suggests that 
 they may in some cases be instances of sophisticated compositional play. </
 p>\n<p>This paper discusses Bach’s use of 1.5-length bars\, or 1.5LB’s\, he
 ard measures consisting of three half bars\, in the initial solos of severa
 l harpsichord concertos.  (The term references Wintersgill’s two-length bar
 \, 1936.)  Of the set of six concertos BWV 1052-1057\, four the first movem
 ents are in compound meters\; of those\, three first solos use 1.5LB’s and 
 the other uses a related technique. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first solos of BWV 
 1052\, 1053\, and 1055 begin with 1.5 LB’s\, one pair in BWV 1053 and two i
 n the others.  In each case they stretch but do not disrupt regular four-ba
 r hypermeter\, as the phrase lengths are five and six notated bars.</li>\n<
 li>In BWV 1053 and 1055\, the surrounding context is otherwise entirely reg
 ular in four-bar construction.</li>\n<li>In BWV 1055\, 1.5LB’s are also use
 d in the ritornello\, in the second four-bar unit\; because of a hypermetri
 cal reinterpretation (Rothstein 1989) as the second unit overlaps with the 
 third\, the 1.5LB’s do not interrupt the regular flow of hyperdownbeats eve
 ry four notated measures.  The first ritornello of BWV 1052 also foreshadow
 s the solo in using a pair of 1.5LB’s\, albeit without the hypermetrical re
 gularity of BWV 1055.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Vivaldi or Telemann\, similar solo
 s would simply reflect business as usual in compound meter.  Here\, the sta
 tistical norms of the works\, the identical formal placement of the 1.5LB’s
 \, and their participation in regular\, four-(heard)-bar groupings all poin
 t to deliberate compositional play.</p>\n
