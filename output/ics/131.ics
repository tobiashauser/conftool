DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Flexibility versus Diversity in Interval-Sizes</stro
 ng>:</p>\n<p>The unanswered question of <em>Mojannab</em> Intervals in <em>
 Persian Dastgah Music</em></p>\n<p>Modal music and microtones\, going toget
 her in most cases\, put the subject of interval-sizes in spotlight.</p>\n<p
 >Despite efforts\, we still face a rather chaotic amount of information on 
 interval-sizes in many of modal music cultures\; including <em>Persian Dast
 gah</em> music. Such information is not only diffused and disparate\, but a
 lso inefficient in explaining the basic questions of perception of modal ch
 aracteristics. Some musicians and musicologists have interpreted diffusion 
 as flexibility (e.g. Farhat 1990)\; a statement with noticeable consequence
 s and questions\; such as: Is such flexibility accepted and practiced when 
 professionals produce their music? Is such flexibility a result of imprecis
 ion in pitch-perception or tolerance caused by diversity?</p>\n<p>In contra
 st to manuscripts on music\, from Iran and its neighbouring cultures betwee
 n 9th and 16th Centuries\, that go into extensive details of interval-sizes
  and sets (<em>Ajnas</em>)\, <em>Persian Dastgah</em> system in the last tw
 o centuries is relying mostly on musiciansâ€™ ears\, in intonation and precis
 ion of intervals\; especially with key intervals in every Dastgah. The most
  characteristic of such intervals is <em>Mojannab: </em>the so-called neutr
 al interval\, loosely described as a three-quarter-tone\, bigger than a sem
 i-tone\, smaller than a whole-tone.</p>\n<p>There have been studies of Pers
 ian <em>Dastgah</em> intervals: a handful of them physically measured fret-
 distances on instruments belonging to masters (Osqueezadeh&Maulana 1995\; F
 arhat 1990)\, a couple of studies measured frequencies of tones in recorded
  performances\, hence the ratios for intervals (Barkeshli 1995\; During 200
 6\; Jeyranzadeh 2013)\, some have been using software analyses on recorded 
 performances to obtain pitch-classes and then intervals in between (Sanati 
 2020\; Shafiei 2021)\, and a few tried to relate the current intonation to 
 either old manuscripts (Kiani 1989) or a systematic tuning concept to prese
 nt the underlying structure in Dastgah tuning (Maulana 1999).</p>\n<p>In th
 is lecture\, I will be looking at the possible hypotheses based on which we
  could re-orchestrate the study of such intervals. Such hypotheses should b
 e formed around perception of each <em>Dastgah</em>\, to see that we might 
 be observing diversity and not flexibility\; diversity that creates differe
 nt modal entities.</p>\n
