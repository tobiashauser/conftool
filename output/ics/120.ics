DESCRIPTION:<p>Some of Hugo Riemann’s harmonic theories have experienced a 
 revival in the US-music theory since the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. Inde
 ed\, Richard Cohn’s work has been an evident milestone for the development 
 of Neo-Riemmanian theories within the field of transformational analysis fo
 r tonal repertoires. For instance\, focusing on parsimony\, instead of priv
 ileging functionality\, has proven extremely useful for the analysis of man
 y passages of 19<sup>th</sup>-century chromatic music.</p>\n\n<p>The Neo-Ri
 emmanian approach also provides opportunities for creative thinking and the
  generation of new scientific knowledge beyond the strict limits of musical
  analysis. On the one hand\, the basic aspects of parsimonious transformati
 ons of chords can be mathematically formalized\; such a formalism can be ex
 ploited to conceive compositional rules by means of particular restrictions
  in the voice leading and distribution of a pooled reservoir of chords. On 
 the other hand\, the use of Neo-Riemmanian visual representations like the 
 <em>Tonnetz</em> may help to explore multimodal aspects of the way we conce
 ptualize music by means of visual patterned structures.</p>\n\n<p>Our lectu
 re-recital is aimed at providing elements of both perspectives mentioned ab
 ove. We will firstly summarize the key features of the Neo-Riemannian theor
 ies for those who are unfamiliar with this approach by using an interactive
  web application developed within the SMIR (Structural Music Information Re
 search) Project. This introduction will be followed by an explanation of ma
 thematical models of voice-leading strategies for composition\, based on gr
 aph-theoretical concepts\, such as Hamiltonian cycles within the Tonnetz. T
 hese ideas will be illustrated through some poetry-based pop songs. For a m
 ore meaningful explanation\, some of these musical examples will be also ac
 companied by visual animations of the underlying Neo-Riemannian representat
 ions. This audiovisual interaction will prepare the audience for an overall
  presentation of our current empirical research on multimodal insights of t
 he <em>Tonnetz</em>. We will devote the second part of the lecture-recital 
 to the discussion of the outcomes of an experiment with musicians and non-m
 usicians interacting with computer-based representations within the <em>Ton
 netz</em>\, and some additional aspects we are exploring in a second ongoin
 g experiment. We will summarize the main results obtained so far and their 
 implications in the context of music theory education.</p>\n
