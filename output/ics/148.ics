DESCRIPTION:<p>Based on the composition „Saber se perder“ for contrabass cl
 arinet\, which was created in a collaborative process\, the composer and th
 e interpreter discuss their perspectives on the process of creation\, devel
 opment and reflect on their individual perspectives on music-theoretical wa
 ys of acting. In this presentation of two artistic research projects that c
 ollide with different questions in interdisciplinary work\, numerous questi
 ons about the musical product and its realization crystallize.</p>\n<p>What
  role does music theory play in the interchange between interpretive and co
 mpositional research? What is the role of the performer in the compositiona
 l process? How do interpreter and composer discuss notation\, influenced by
  their different viewpoints? Where do contradictions or conflicts arise? Wh
 at is the reciprocal relationship between the compositional process and int
 erpretive learning? And how is interpretive learning influenced by music-th
 eoretical and analytical questions?</p>\n<p>From a compositional point of v
 iew\, the work on „Saber se perder“ explores the question of how the multi-
 perspectival relationship between music and text – as well as the idea of a
  musical documentation via text – affect the compositional process. Trigger
 ed by the intensive source research\, analysis work and reappraisal of the 
 production process of the composition A-Ronne by Luciano Berio\, a field of
  experimentation that emerged historically in the 1970s is to be updated an
 d examined here with contemporary means. In the process\, the reciprocal re
 lationship between scientific work and artistic questioning proves to be a 
 creative force\, a contradiction and mutual enrichment.</p>\n<p>The interpr
 etative research deals with the performance practice of Complexist music\, 
 and strives to identify\, understand\, and suggest a set of tools to approa
 ch and resolve the challenges of notation\, techniques\, and their longevit
 y. The question of musical text reproduction and understanding\, as well as
  the embodied physicality required for “Saber se perder” poses a complex ch
 allenge that comes from the translation of notation. In a reciprocal proces
 s\, the practice and the theoretical musical analysis bring a holistic and 
 embodied process of learning in the realization of this work.</p>\n<p>The l
 ive performance will complement this lecture recital and provides a concret
 e link between theoretical reflection and artistic insights.</p>\n
