 l investigates the development of piano virtuosity during the 20th century\
 , presenting a combination of the Etudes op. 42 (1969) by the Finnish compo
 ser Einojuhani Rautavaara (1928–2016) and a selection from the first Book o
 f Etudes (1915) by Claude Debussy (1862-1918)\, which served as a source of
  inspiration for Rautavaara. The decision to focus on two collections of et
 udes on intervals was influenced by the presence of this form in different 
 historical periods and by the role it has played since the Romanticism to d
 emonstrate virtuosity. The program presents the etudes as a complete set st
 ructured in ascending order of intervals\, with no repetition\, revealing s
 imilarities and differences in the composers' approaches to virtuosity and 
 enabling the audience to recognize elements of continuity and innovation wi
 th the tradition. The performance of the Etudes will be preceded by a discu
 ssion that will reflect on the concept of virtuosity in piano performance b
 y exploring the relationship between contemporary techniques and traditiona
 l criteria of technical mastery such as speed\, precision\, power\, and dex
 terity. By challenging the traditional notion of virtuosity in light of the
  aesthetic and stylistic changes in modern music\, the discussion will refl
 ect on the expectations and the skills required from performers to play thi
 s repertoire and be recognized as virtuosos.</p>\n<p>This research combines
  the examination of scores and interviews with pianists\, analysis of a pra
 ctice diary\, and impressions from my public performances of Rautavaara's a
 nd Debussy's etudes. These concerts will provide an opportunity to explore 
 the impact of this type of virtuosity on the audience and to examine which 
 settings are most effective to showcase this type of virtuosity\, including
  considerations on the type of piano and acoustic.</p>\n
