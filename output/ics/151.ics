DESCRIPTION:<p>As Steven Vande Moortele (2015) notes\, Theodor Adorno has f
 aced divergent receptions within English-speaking contemporary music theory
  and musicology. Adorno’s ideology critique of modernity and the culture in
 dustry was especially influential on the so-called ‘New Musicology’ of the 
 1990s\, whose elevation of historical-cultural context foreshadows recent m
 usicological preoccupations with political activism and social justice. Alt
 hough musicology’s contextual-political turn problematises theory and analy
 sis’s traditional focus on the musical object\, this criticism remains at o
 dds with Adorno’s (1982) wider account of music analysis (Horton 2020). Whi
 le Adorno’s own ‘<em>materiale Formenlehre </em>and his categories of Break
 through\, Suspension\, Fulfilment\, Collapse\, etc. have received some atte
 ntion (Paddison 1993\; Wedler 2013)\, his music theory remains largely negl
 ected within contemporary formal theory\, the ‘New <em>Formenlehre’</em> in
 itiated by Caplin’s Form-functional Theory and Hepokoski and Darcy’s Sonata
  Theory. This uneven reception has obscured Adorno’s particular music theor
 y and its musicological implications.</p>\n<p>This paper reconsiders Adorno
 ’s relevance for contemporary musicology and music theory through the conce
 pt of Breakthrough (<em>Durchbruch</em>). Breakthrough provides a rare inte
 rsection between the New Musicology’s contextual focus and the New <em>Form
 enlehre</em>’s engagement with the music itself. First popularised in Adorn
 o’s (1971) seminal Mahler book\, this intrusive formal event – which critic
 ally alters a symphony’s formal and expressive narratives – undermines comp
 rehensive theoretical understanding and resists a standardised account. Wit
 hin Adorno’s <em>materiale Formenlehre</em>\, Breakthrough constitutes an e
 xceptional moment that facilitates ideology critique\, particularly in Beet
 hoven and Mahler’s symphonies. Adorno’s emphasis on Beethoven and Mahler is
  reinforced by James Buhler (1996)\, who builds on Bernd Sponheuer to empha
 sise Breakthrough’s “immanent critique” of form. James Hepokoski (1992)\, c
 ontrastingly\, originates Breakthrough with Schumann and normalises it as a
  standard nineteenth-century procedure within the New <em>Formenlehre</em>.
  These conceptual divergences from Adorno are compounded by additional cont
 ributions which locate Breakthrough in a wider range of nineteenth-century 
 European repertoire\, thereby complicating its characteristics. By untangli
 ng Breakthrough's complex reception history\, this paper reconciles Adorno’
 s account with the New <em>Formenlehre</em> to clarify the concept's decons
 tructive\, critical potential. The resulting framework of Breakthrough enha
 nces contemporary formal discourse and recontextualises the centrality of m
 usic theory for musicology’s contemporary socio-political impact.</p>\n
