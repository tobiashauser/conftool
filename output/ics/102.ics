DESCRIPTION:<p>This presentation reveals some of the artistic and critical 
 discoveries and challenges encountered in the process of exploring Émile Sa
 uret through the making of a world premiere recording series of his 24 Étud
 es Caprices\, op.64. Partially recorded on his c.1685 Stradivari violin\, t
 he project spanned four discs and has been issued as a series by Naxos betw
 een 2017 and 2020.</p>\n<p>The violin virtuoso\, composer and pedagogue\, É
 mile Sauret carved himself an enviable reputation during his lifetime. Some
 times described as a successor to Paganini\, he was acclaimed by some of th
 e greatest musicians of his era\, including Brahms\, Liszt\, Tchaikovsky an
 d Sarasate. Today\, however\, Sauret’s work seems very little known\, and h
 e is predominantly remembered by violinists for the fiendishly difficult ca
 denza he composed to Paganini’s Violin Concerto no. 1.</p>\n<p>During his 1
 2-year professorial tenure at the Royal Academy of Music between 1891 and 1
 903\, Sauret produced in 1902 his last major pedagogical publication - the 
 24 Etudes Caprices\, op.64\, published by Simrock. These works are a testam
 ent to his technical finesse and are dedicated to his student\, the English
  virtuoso Marjorie Hayward.</p>\n<p>The Études Caprices are inundated with 
 specific dynamic\, fingered\, bowed indications and infused with an extraor
 dinary density of variations\, only rarely used for show\, rather drawing t
 he ear away from the repetition at the core of an étude. For the player\, t
 his unending variety\, and the resultant length of the series (amounting to
  nearly four-and-a- half-hours of continuous music)\, is an invocation to d
 raw every resource of expressiveness from the instrument.</p>\n
