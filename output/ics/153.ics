DESCRIPTION:<p dir="ltr">My opera “La Locandiera”\, based on the celebrated
  play by the eighteenth-century dramatist Carlo Goldoni\, premiered in Nove
 mber 2022 in a performance involving students and associates of my universi
 ty and which I directed personally from the harpsichord. Written in an eleg
 ant Classical style\, “La Locandiera” pays homage to the late eighteenth-ce
 ntury Viennese opera buffa tradition. This project will provide the focus f
 or my presentation\, along with the following two theses:</p>\n<p dir="ltr"
 >1. My opera\, composed in eighteenth-century style\, is a form of contempo
 rary art\, participating in a growing creative movement centered around com
 position in historical styles. From this perspective\, I will discuss certa
 in aesthetic notions of authenticity\, forgery\, pastiche\, etc. in an effo
 rt to situate such composition within a contemporary artistic context. I wi
 ll also draw comparisons and discuss the relationship between composition i
 n historical styles and various aspects of historically-informed performanc
 e (HIP). Paralleling each other in various ways\, and my conception of the 
 former largely stemming from the latter\, HIP can offer insight into many o
 f the issues and questions which face composition in historical styles.</p>
 \n<p dir="ltr">2. Composition in historical styles can provide the foundati
 on for artistic research\, which I will demonstrate using examples from my 
 opera. As such\, I will examine and discuss some of the unique insights tha
 t this kind of composition can offer with respect to the music of the past\
 , in particular its potential for elucidating the process of creation\, art
 istic thought\, and other issues of an inherently abstract nature which are
  otherwise difficult to pinpoint through the conventional scientific method
 s of music analysis and musicology.</p>\n
