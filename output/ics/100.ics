DESCRIPTION:<p>William Caplin’s (<em>Classical Form</em>\, 1998) theory of 
 thematic hybrids and Clemens Kühn’s (<em>Formenlehre der Musik\, </em>1987)
  concept of thematic <em>Mischungen</em> (mixtures) provide two similar sol
 utions to a significant problem in the analysis of themes: cases that are n
 ot clearly sentences or periods. Hybrids and <em>Mischungen</em> produce co
 ntrasting analytical results\, detailed in this presentation\, but particul
 arly different theoretical emphases. Caplin and Kühn’s theories of form are
  based on fundamentally different models of musical temporality. On the one
  hand\, Caplin theorizes that there are a limited set of temporal relations
 hips a passage may fulfill: beginnings\, middles\, ends\, before-the-beginn
 ings\, and after-the-ends. On the other hand\, Kühn argues that there are a
  limited number of ways one passage may relate to another passage\, in term
 s of content: repetition (AA)\, variation\, difference (AAʹ)\, contrast (AB
 )\, and unrelatedness.</p>\n<p>In his theory of hybrids\, Caplin demonstrat
 es a set of combinations between different phrases (such as presentation an
 d antecedent) which generate a range of hybrid theme types concatenating pe
 riodic with sentential phrase structures. Kühn develops a theory of <em>Mis
 chung</em> which describes how themes may integrate sentential and periodic
  traits more generally. This includes effects across entire themes where fe
 atures of each primary theme type integrate on various levels of structure.
  Kühn categorizes <em>Mischungen</em> according to four archetypes: sentenc
 e with periodic antecedent\; period with sentential antecedent\; overlayed 
 themes\; and escalation.</p>\n<p>By investigating Kühn’s four musical examp
 les of the categories of <em>Mischung</em> (Haydn Hob XVI/27 Finale\; Beeth
 oven Op. 49 No. 2 second movement\; Beethoven Op. 2 1 second movement\; and
  Mozart Violin Concerto in A K219 third movement)\, I explore how the two t
 heorists’ views of the similar topic differ analytically before expanding t
 o consider their contrasting theoretical frameworks. Despite the difference
 s in their concepts of hybridity and <em>Mischung</em>\, both reveal the in
 fluence of their teacher Carl Dahlhaus and bear comparison with the theoris
 t’s “Satz und Periode: zur Theorie der musikalischen Syntax” (1978). I conc
 lude the presentation with a discussion of the passages of influence implie
 d by the similarities in Caplin’s and Kühn’s theories in the context of Dah
 lhaus’s work and teaching.</p>\n
