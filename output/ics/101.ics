DESCRIPTION:<p>The epistemological rift between Schenkerian and neo-Riemann
 ian theory runs deep. Particularly in relation to questions of musical time
 \, this rift has profound hermeneutic implications\, as can be glimpsed\, f
 or example\, through a comparison of David Beach’s and Suzannah Clark’s int
 erpretations of the opening exposition of Schubert’s G major String Quartet
  D. 887. Whereas Beach’s Schenkerian reading highlights with reference to t
 he tonic-dominant axis a teleological — ‘end-accented’ — orientation of the
  musical discourse\, effectively attributing to it a sense of ‘narrative’ t
 ime as habitually associated with Beethoven’s heroic style\, Clark’s neo-Ri
 emannian perspective discerns in the hexatonic cycling woven into the tonal
  geometry a fingerprint of Schubert’s ‘lyrical’ imagination\, a mode of sus
 pended temporality that she considers decisively ‘non-Beethovenian’ (or\, i
 ndeed\, uniquely ‘Schubertian’). Owing to the specific epistemological cali
 brations built into each respective theoretical lens\, these two interpreta
 tions reveal a basic hermeneutic-logical contradiction: (how) is it possibl
 e that the same music is teleological and non-teleological at once?</p>\n<p
 > The aim of this paper is to critically reappraise this contradiction. Whi
 le carrying no real weight in the arena of music analytical plausibility\, 
 this contradiction drills down to the bedrock of all modern (post-Gadameria
 n) hermeneutic philosophy: the cardinal problem that the ‘truth’ produced b
 y a certain ‘method’ is critically shaped by it. Drawing upon Nelson Goodma
 n’s concept of ‘world versions’ — a solipsistic-constructivist theory of co
 nceptualising truth claims — this paper explores to what extent opposing in
 terpretations of musical time can be understood as representing different ‘
 versions’ arising from the multivalent symbol system which makes up the ind
 ividual work\, the ‘world’. Once cast in this light\, the epistemological i
 nconsistencies underpinning the hermeneutics of musical time can be reframe
 d as heuristic opportunities\, rather than impasses\, in the way that they 
 engage us to rethink the normative grounds for claims about musical time wi
 thout all too conveniently essentialising it.</p>\n
