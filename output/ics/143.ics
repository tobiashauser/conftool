DESCRIPTION:<p>Since the introduction of the first commercially available s
 pectrographs\, the process of deconstructing spectrograms into various symb
 olic representations has played a vital role in music composition. Risset a
 nd Wessel (1999) described this process as an "exploration of timbre by ana
 lysis and synthesis\," which involved not only the decomposition of various
  machine-generated representations into sheet music notation\, a crucial as
 pect of spectral music (Kursell & Schäfer\, 2016)\, but also the creation o
 f frequency tables central to computer-synthesized works (Harvey\, 1981). F
 urthermore\, they emphasized the importance of an "acute ear and judgment" 
 as a key factor in the creative process\, necessitating active interaction 
 not only as an analyst but also as a listener or interpreter\, ultimately l
 eading to a deeper understanding of the musical material.</p>\n<p>This conc
 ept\, which combines analysis\, synthesis\, and acoustical perception into 
 a cohesive process\, has been pivotal for the development of several softwa
 re designs\, dating back to Music V (1967) (Risset\, 1994). Environments li
 ke OpenMusic and Audiosculpt\, along with their various possibilities for i
 nterconnectivity\, have excelled in embodying this concept\, allowing compl
 ex interactions between analysis\, symbolic representation\, and resynthesi
 s. Unfortunately\, due to the discontinuation of Audiosculpt's development 
 and the incompatibility of its latest version with modern 64-bit systems\, 
 many useful interactions familiar to users in the 2000-2010s have become in
 accessible on current platforms.</p>\n<p>In response to this challenge\, we
  developed several Python-based tools centered around analysis\, sonificati
 on\, and symbolic representation. These tools were primarily based on adapt
 ations of FMP Notebook scripts (Müller\, 2021) and the Verovio framework (P
 ugin et al.\, 2014). We refined their practical functionality through sever
 al lecture cycles at HMT Leipzig\, resulting in a robust and versatile set 
 of tools designed for musicologists\, composers\, and researchers. In our p
 lanned talk\, we aim to showcase multiple implementations of our toolset\, 
 with a focus on pattern recognition applications for a range of analytical 
 and creative purposes.</p>\n
